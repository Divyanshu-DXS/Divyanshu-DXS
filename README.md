# Hey there! Dev here ðŸ‘‹. Learning, crafting, experimenting, and growing.

## About Me
ðŸš€ Software Engineer | Java Backend Developer | Cybersecurity Aware <br>
ðŸš€ Fueled by curiosity, driven by innovation, and secured by passion! <br>
<br>
I design and develop **robust backend systems** with a primary focus on **Java, Spring Boot, and distributed application architecture**. My work emphasizes **clean code, concurrency management, API design, and database integration**, ensuring solutions are both **scalable and maintainable**.  

I bring a **security-conscious approach** to development, integrating practices such as **log analysis, threat detection, and vulnerability assessment** into the engineering lifecycle. This dual expertise enables me to build systems that are **efficient, resilient, and secure by design**.
